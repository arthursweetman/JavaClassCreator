# JavaClassCreator

## Description
This is a program I created my sophomore year of undergrad. The purpose is to quickly and easily create a new Java Class/object by simply inputting a data set. This program can save the user hours of the mundane coding of many individual Java Classes.

## Prerequisites
You can use this program for any data set you like. The only specification is:
* The data set must be at least two (2) lines where the first line contains the variable names and the following line(s) contain the appropriate data values.

## Getting Started
1. Clone repository
2. Open `Tester.java` in your preferred IDE
3. Edit the following text between quotes ("") so that it matches the name of the file you want to create a Class with (note that the .txt file must also be in your working directory)
```
String fileName = "Student";
```
4. Run file
5. Refresh your directory and view the outputted .class file
